HW3 README

In this code an Airfoil class is created to read and process data files
associated with an airfoil at multiple angles of attack. 

The object of the Airfoil class is then printed in the main.py file. The data of the object
is imported from files in the specified directory and encapsulated in internal data strutures
created by methods in the class.

Program decomposition & Data encapsulation:

There are total of 6 methods created in the Airfoil class to decompose the program:

1.__init__ (self, naca_folder)
This initialization method creates a instance for the main.py file.
 
2.self.load_geometry(self,naca_folder)
This function reads data from xy.dat file and encapsulate exported data into a list 
containing (x,y) coordiniates for the panel.

3.self.load_alpha(self,naca_folder)
This function creates a dictionary to encapsulate Cp values for each angle of attack, 
with each angle as a key and corresponding a list of Cp. 

4.self.find_lift_coeff(self,geometry, alpha)
This function calculates lift coefficient for each angle of attack.

5.self.find_stag_point(self,geometry, alpha)
This function calculates the stagnation points at different alpha 
angles and return a list of stagnation points

6.self.generate_summary()
Generate a summary of lift coefficient and stagnation points at different alpha angles


Error handling:

Errors are rasied in three cases in the program:
1. when the argument to Airfoil class is not a valid directory. 
error message: not a valid directory

2. when required data files cannot be found int the data directory.
error message: data file cannot be found.

3.error is detected in reading an input file
error message: errors in the data file.
